<h1>Feedback on DB assignment</h1>

<p>You've done the main stages plus some UI work.
</p>

<p>Your classes are generally neat, but they don't have comments at the top to
  summarize design decisions or give the reader an overview.
</p>

<p>The main problem is that your fields are not private. And you do in fact access
them 'illegally' from outside the classes. So your classes are not robust and
provide no guarantees.
</p>

<p>The design of the classes seems quite reasonable, though, and you made
quite a lot of progress.
</p>

<p>Also, see your automatically generated style feedback:</p>

<h2>General feedback</h2>

<p>I gave some credit for the amount of work you did, but mostly I was looking
for evidence of steady development and a good robust final design with
testing.</p>

<p>Here is my stage-by-stage development of the assignment, including design
decisions and source code. Download the zip file, unzip it, and view the
top-level index.html file in your browser:</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common design weakness in your projects, that I haven't
necessarily mentioned in your individual feedback, is for your record class to
end up too small and the other classes too big, because you haven't made the
record class responsible for <em>all</em> one-row operations. That means you are
getting data out of records and manipulating it elsewhere. As well as being
unbalanced, this is less robust than it could be, because the record class
doesn't then give guarantees about <em>all</em> one-row issues.</p>

<p>I am not promising that my final program is bug-free. But I hope you will
check it for tips on where to put code, how to make really robust components,
how classes can evolve, how to leave user interaction until late on, what kind
of tricks you can use, how to refactor (e.g. switching from indexes to keys) or
whatever. And you might like to compare your total number of lines to mine, for
similar functionality.</p>
